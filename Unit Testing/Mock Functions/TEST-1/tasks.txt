UNIT TESTING
-> jest

-- Here we are mocking functions

1. Test get all authors

Create a test case to verify that the getAuthors function returns all author records using jest mock functions.

Ensure the test case checks the length of the returned array.

Verify that the returned array matches the expected author records.

2. Test get author by ID

Create a test case to verify that the getAuthorById function returns the correct author record when provided with a valid ID using jest mock functions.

Verify that the returned object matches the expected author record.

3. Test get author by non-existent ID

Create a test case to verify that the getAuthorById function returns undefined when provided with a non-existent ID using jest mock functions.

4. Test add new author

Create a test case to verify that the addAuthor function successfully adds a new author record using jest mock functions.

Ensure the test case checks the returned object for the new author.
